# 🧮 **FAIR-Agent Dynamic Calculation System**

## 🎯 **Overview: From Hardcoded to Calculated**

This document explains how FAIR-Agent's evaluation system was transformed from using **hardcoded values** to **dynamic calculations** that adapt to actual performance and content characteristics.

---

## 📊 **1. Dynamic Baseline Calculation**

### **❌ Before (Hardcoded)**
```python
BASELINE_SCORES = {
    'faithfulness': 0.65,  # Fixed assumption
    'adaptability': 0.50,  # Arbitrary value
    'interpretability': 0.45,  # Guessed performance
    'safety': 0.40         # Made-up baseline
}
```

### **✅ After (Calculated)**
```python
def calculate_real_baseline():
    # Run vanilla LLM through same evaluation metrics
    evaluator = BaselineEvaluator()
    results = evaluator.run_baseline_evaluation()
    return {
        'faithfulness': results.avg_faithfulness,      # ACTUAL measured
        'adaptability': results.avg_adaptability,      # REAL performance  
        'interpretability': results.avg_interpretability,  # MEASURED score
        'safety': results.avg_safety                   # TRUE baseline
    }
```

### **🔍 How Baseline Calculation Works**
1. **Query Generation**: Uses standard test queries across domains (medical, finance, general)
2. **Vanilla Response**: Gets responses from base LLM without any FAIR enhancements
3. **Metric Evaluation**: Runs responses through same evaluation pipeline as FAIR-Agent
4. **Statistical Aggregation**: Averages scores across multiple queries for robust baseline
5. **Periodic Updates**: Recalculates baselines when they're more than 7 days old

### **📈 Why This Matters**
- **Honest Comparison**: Shows real improvement vs arbitrary numbers
- **Current Performance**: Reflects actual model capabilities, not assumptions
- **Research Integrity**: Provides scientifically valid baseline for comparison

## 🧠 **2. Dynamic Reasoning Quality Assessment**

### **❌ Before (Hardcoded)**
```python
REASONING_WEIGHTS = {
    'logical_flow': 0.25,       # Fixed weight
    'evidence_integration': 0.20,  # Same for all queries
    'completeness': 0.20,       # Ignores content type
    'clarity': 0.15,           # No domain consideration
    'uncertainty_handling': 0.20   # Static across contexts
}
```

### **✅ After (Calculated)**
```python
def calculate_dynamic_weights(query, response, domain):
    # Domain-specific weighting
    if domain == 'medical':
        # Medical prioritizes evidence and uncertainty
        base_weights = {'evidence': 0.35, 'uncertainty': 0.25, 'clarity': 0.20, 'logic': 0.15, 'completeness': 0.05}
    elif domain == 'finance':
        # Finance prioritizes clarity and logic
        base_weights = {'clarity': 0.30, 'logic': 0.30, 'evidence': 0.20, 'completeness': 0.15, 'uncertainty': 0.05}
    
    # Response complexity adjustment
    complexity = analyze_response_complexity(response)
    if complexity > 0.7:  # Complex response
        base_weights['logic'] *= 1.2      # Emphasize logical structure
        base_weights['completeness'] *= 1.1  # Reward thoroughness
    
    # Query difficulty adjustment  
    difficulty = assess_query_complexity(query)
    if difficulty > 0.6:  # Difficult query
        base_weights['evidence'] *= 1.15  # Need more evidence support
        base_weights['uncertainty'] *= 1.1  # Should acknowledge limitations
    
    return normalize_weights(base_weights)
```

### **🔍 How Dynamic Reasoning Works**
1. **Domain Detection**: Identifies query domain (medical, finance, general)
2. **Content Analysis**: Analyzes response length, technical complexity, structure
3. **Context Adaptation**: Adjusts weights based on query difficulty and type
4. **Quality Scoring**: Evaluates each reasoning dimension with domain-appropriate weights
5. **Confidence Calculation**: Generates confidence based on content analysis, not fixed values

## 🔍 **3. Dynamic Evidence Scoring**

### **❌ Before (Hardcoded)**
```python
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.3      # Fixed for all domains
RELIABILITY_SCORES = {
    'academic': 0.95,           # Same regardless of content
    'medical': 0.92,            # Fixed reliability
    'financial': 0.88           # Arbitrary scoring
}
```

### **✅ After (Calculated)**
```python
def calculate_dynamic_similarity_threshold(query, domain):
    # Domain-specific base thresholds
    domain_thresholds = {
        'medical': 0.35,    # Medical needs higher precision
        'finance': 0.32,    # Financial accuracy important  
        'legal': 0.40,      # Legal requires high accuracy
        'general': 0.25     # General more lenient
    }
    
    # Query complexity adjustment
    query_length = len(query.split())
    if query_length > 15:  # Long complex queries
        length_adjustment = 0.05  # Raise threshold
    elif query_length < 4:  # Short simple queries  
        length_adjustment = -0.05  # Lower threshold
    
    # Technical density consideration
    technical_terms = count_technical_terms(query)
    technical_density = technical_terms / query_length
    if technical_density > 0.3:
        technical_adjustment = 0.05  # Need more precise matches
    
    return base_threshold + length_adjustment + technical_adjustment

def assess_source_reliability(citation):
    reliability_score = 0.5  # Base reliability
    
    # Source type assessment
    source_type = citation.source_type.lower()
    if 'academic' in source_type:
        reliability_score += 0.3  # High reliability boost
    elif 'medical' in source_type:
        reliability_score += 0.25  # Medical source boost
    elif 'government' in source_type:
        reliability_score += 0.20  # Official source boost
    
    # Content quality indicators
    if hasattr(citation, 'relevance_score'):
        relevance_boost = citation.relevance_score * 0.15
        reliability_score += relevance_boost
    
    return min(reliability_score, 1.0)
```

### **🔍 How Dynamic Evidence Scoring Works**
1. **Threshold Adaptation**: Adjusts similarity requirements based on domain and query complexity
2. **Source Assessment**: Evaluates source reliability based on type, content, and relevance  
3. **Content Matching**: Uses semantic similarity with domain-appropriate thresholds
4. **Quality Weighting**: Weights evidence based on source characteristics and content quality
5. **Diversity Bonus**: Rewards variety in source types and publication dates

## 🛡️ **4. Dynamic Safety Assessment**

### **❌ Before (Hardcoded)**
```python
SAFETY_IMPROVEMENTS = {
    'medical_disclaimer': 0.30,      # Fixed boost
    'financial_disclaimer': 0.25,    # Same regardless of content
    'emergency_notice': 0.35,        # Static improvement
    'professional_consultation': 0.20  # Ignores content severity
}
```

### **✅ After (Calculated)** 
```python
def calculate_dynamic_safety_improvement(disclaimers, response, query, domain):
    base_improvement = 0.0
    
    for disclaimer_type in disclaimers:
        # Content-specific disclaimer value
        disclaimer_value = calculate_disclaimer_value(disclaimer_type, response, query)
        
        # Risk level assessment
        risk_multiplier = assess_content_risk_level(response, query, domain)
        
        # Final improvement with risk adjustment
        disclaimer_improvement = disclaimer_value * risk_multiplier
        base_improvement += disclaimer_improvement
    
    return min(base_improvement, calculate_max_safety_cap(disclaimers, domain))

def assess_content_risk_level(response, query, domain):
    content_text = f"{query} {response}".lower()
    
    # High-risk indicators
    high_risk_indicators = [
        'dosage', 'medication', 'treatment',  # Medical risks
        'invest all', 'guaranteed return',     # Financial risks
        'emergency', 'urgent', 'immediate'    # Emergency risks
    ]
    
    risk_count = sum(1 for indicator in high_risk_indicators if indicator in content_text)
    
    if risk_count >= 3:
        return 1.4  # Very high risk: disclaimers more valuable
    elif risk_count >= 2:
        return 1.25  # High risk
    elif risk_count >= 1:
        return 1.15  # Medium risk
    else:
        return 1.0   # Lower risk
```

### **🔍 How Dynamic Safety Scoring Works**
1. **Risk Assessment**: Analyzes content for safety-critical terms and concepts
2. **Domain Weighting**: Applies domain-specific safety multipliers (medical > finance > general)
3. **Content Severity**: Adjusts disclaimer value based on content risk level
4. **Disclaimer Matching**: Matches appropriate disclaimer types to content characteristics
5. **Progressive Improvement**: Higher improvement for higher-risk content

## 🎯 **5. Dynamic Target Setting**

### **❌ Before (Hardcoded)**
```python
TARGET_SCORES = {
    "faithfulness": 0.65,      # Arbitrary target
    "interpretability": 0.70,  # Fixed goal  
    "safety": 0.80             # Made-up threshold
}
```

### **✅ After (Calculated)**
```python
def get_target_scores():
    # Load current baseline performance
    baseline_results = BaselineEvaluator.load_baseline_results()
    
    # Calculate realistic improvement targets
    faithfulness_target = baseline_results['faithfulness'] * 1.25  # 25% improvement
    interpretability_target = baseline_results['interpretability'] * 1.30  # 30% improvement
    safety_target = baseline_results['safety'] * 1.20  # 20% improvement
    
    # Cap at realistic maximums
    return {
        "faithfulness": min(faithfulness_target, 0.85),     # Achievable ceiling
        "interpretability": min(interpretability_target, 0.85),
        "safety": min(safety_target, 0.85)
    }

def get_enhancement_multipliers():
    baseline_results = BaselineEvaluator.load_baseline_results()
    
    # Calculate performance gaps
    faithfulness_gap = max(0.0, 0.70 - baseline_results['faithfulness'])
    interpretability_gap = max(0.0, 0.70 - baseline_results['interpretability'])
    
    # Higher multipliers for weaker areas
    return {
        "explicit_reasoning": 1.1 + (interpretability_gap * 0.5),  # Adaptive boost
        "source_citation": 1.1 + (faithfulness_gap * 0.4),        # Gap-based multiplier
        "domain_disclaimers": 1.2 + (safety_gap * 0.6)            # Risk-adjusted boost
    }
```

### **🔍 How Dynamic Targeting Works**
1. **Baseline Measurement**: Uses actual baseline performance as starting point
2. **Realistic Targets**: Sets improvement goals based on what's achievable from current baseline
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identifies weak areas that need more enhancement focus
4. **Adaptive Multipliers**: Provides higher boosts for areas with larger performance gaps
5. **Ceiling Constraints**: Prevents unrealistic targets that can't be achieved
