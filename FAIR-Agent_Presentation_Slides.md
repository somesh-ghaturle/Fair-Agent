## Slide 3: Literature Review - Previous Work

### Key Research Areas

**1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Lewis et al. (2020): Combined parametric/non-parametric knowledge
- *Gap:* Lack of systematic trustworthiness evaluation

**2. Hallucination Detection**  
- Ji et al. (2023): Post-hoc detection strategies
- *Gap:* Reactive rather than proactive prevention

**3. Medical AI Explainability**
- Rajkomar et al. (2018): Attention-based interpretability
- *Gap:* Domain-specific, not generalizable

**4. Financial AI Risk Assessment**
- Hendrycks et al. (2021): Mathematical reasoning evaluation  
- *Gap:* Calculation focus, not risk communication
