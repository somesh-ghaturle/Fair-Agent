    title: "Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease"
    content: |
      Low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg daily) reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults aged 40-70 years 
      with elevated cardiovascular risk and low bleeding risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends 
      individualized decision-making based on cardiovascular risk factors, bleeding risk, and patient preferences. 
      Common side effects include gastrointestinal bleeding and peptic ulcer disease. Contraindications include 
      active bleeding, severe liver disease, and recent hemorrhagic stroke.

    title: "Diabetes Management Guidelines - Type 2 Diabetes"
    content: |
      Type 2 diabetes management involves lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and weight management, 
      combined with pharmacological interventions when necessary. Metformin is typically the first-line medication 
      due to its efficacy, safety profile, and cardiovascular benefits. Regular monitoring of HbA1c (target <7% 
      for most adults), blood pressure (<130/80 mmHg), and lipid levels is essential. GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 
      inhibitors offer additional benefits for patients with cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease.

      Hypertension is defined as systolic BP ≥130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥80 mmHg. Initial treatment includes 
      lifestyle modifications: DASH diet, sodium reduction (<1500 mg/day), weight loss if overweight, regular 
      physical activity (150 min/week), and alcohol moderation. First-line antihypertensive medications include 
      ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Blood pressure targets are generally 
      <130/80 mmHg for most adults. Combination therapy is often needed for BP >20/10 mmHg above goal.

    title: "Antibiotic Use and Resistance - Clinical Guidelines"
    content: |
      Antibiotic stewardship is critical to combat resistance. Antibiotics should only be used for bacterial 
      infections, not viral illnesses like colds or flu. Common bacterial infections include strep throat, urinary 
      tract infections, and bacterial pneumonia. Proper dosing and completing the full course is essential, even 
      if symptoms improve. Overuse leads to antibiotic resistance, making infections harder to treat. Providers 
      should use narrow-spectrum antibiotics when possible and order cultures to guide therapy.

      COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged 6 months and older. The primary series provides 
      foundational immunity, while updated boosters target current circulating variants. Side effects are typically 
      mild (arm soreness, fatigue, headache) and resolve within 1-2 days. Contraindications include severe allergic 
      reaction to vaccine components. Benefits significantly outweigh risks across all age groups. Immunocompromised 
      individuals may require additional doses for optimal protection.

    title: "Cholesterol Management and Statin Therapy"
    content: |
      Elevated LDL cholesterol increases cardiovascular disease risk. Lifestyle modifications include diet 
      (reduce saturated fat, increase fiber), exercise, and weight management. Statins are first-line therapy 
      for most patients with elevated LDL or high cardiovascular risk. Target LDL <100 mg/dL for high-risk patients, 
      <70 mg/dL for very high-risk. Common side effects include muscle aches (5-10% of patients) and rarely 
      rhabdomyolysis. Monitor liver enzymes initially, then as clinically indicated.

      Opioids should be reserved for severe acute pain or cancer-related pain. Non-opioid alternatives include 
      acetaminophen, NSAIDs, physical therapy, and other modalities. When opioids are prescribed, use the lowest 
      effective dose for the shortest duration necessary. Screen for substance use disorders and overdose risk. 
      Prescribe naloxone for patients at risk of overdose. Monitor closely and taper when appropriate. The CDC 
      recommends avoiding doses >90 MME (morphine milligram equivalents) daily for chronic pain.

    title: "Portfolio Diversification Principles - Modern Portfolio Theory"
    content: |
      Modern portfolio theory demonstrates that diversification across uncorrelated assets reduces portfolio risk 
      without proportionally reducing expected returns. The efficient frontier represents optimal risk-return 
      combinations. Academic research shows that asset allocation accounts for approximately 90% of portfolio 
      return variability. Geographic diversification (domestic/international), sector diversification (technology, 
      healthcare, finance, etc.), and asset class diversification (stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities) provide 
      risk reduction benefits. Correlation coefficients between assets should be considered when building portfolios.

    title: "Interest Rate and Bond Price Relationship"
    content: |
      Bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship due to discounted cash flow principles. When 
      interest rates rise, existing bonds with lower coupon rates become less attractive, causing their prices to 
      fall. Duration measures price sensitivity to interest rate changes - longer-duration bonds experience greater 
      price volatility. A bond with duration of 5 years will decline approximately 5% in value for each 1% increase 
      in interest rates. Convexity provides additional refinement to duration estimates for larger rate changes.

      Cryptocurrency markets exhibit extreme volatility with daily price movements often exceeding 10%. Bitcoin 
      has experienced multiple bear markets with peak-to-trough declines exceeding 80%. Contributing factors include 
      regulatory uncertainty, technological risks, market manipulation, limited liquidity, and speculative trading. 
      The SEC and other regulators continue developing frameworks for digital asset oversight. Investors should only 
      allocate capital they can afford to lose. Custody security, exchange counterparty risk, and tax reporting 
      complexities are additional considerations. Not suitable for risk-averse investors or short-term needs.

    title: "Retirement Planning Best Practices"
    content: |
      Financial advisors recommend saving 10-15% of gross income for retirement, starting in one's 20s. The power 
      of compound growth makes early saving crucial - each decade delayed roughly requires doubling the savings rate. 
      Tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k)s (contribution limit $23,000 in 2024) and IRAs (limit $7,000) provide 
      substantial benefits through tax-deferred or tax-free growth. Employer matching contributions offer immediate 
      guaranteed returns. Target-date funds offer age-appropriate asset allocation automatically. The rule of 110 
      (110 minus age = % in stocks) provides a rough allocation guideline. Social Security provides foundational 
      income but should be supplemented with personal savings.

    content: |
      Index funds track market indices like the S&P 500, providing broad diversification at low cost (expense ratios 
      typically 0.03-0.20%). Research shows that 85-90% of actively managed funds underperform their benchmark index 
      over 10-year periods, after accounting for fees. Dollar-cost averaging (regular fixed investments) reduces 
      timing risk and helps manage volatility. Historical S&P 500 returns average 10% annually before inflation 
      (7% real returns) over long periods, though individual years vary widely. Index investing suits long-term 
      investors who prefer a hands-off, low-cost approach aligned with market returns.

    title: "Emergency Fund and Liquid Savings Recommendations"
    content: |
      Financial planners recommend maintaining 3-6 months of essential living expenses in an emergency fund. This 
      provides a buffer for unexpected job loss, medical expenses, or major repairs. Emergency funds should be kept 
      in liquid, safe accounts like high-yield savings accounts or money market funds, not invested in stocks or 
      bonds that can lose value when needed. Dual-income households may use lower end (3 months), while single-income 
      households or those with variable income should target 6+ months. Build the fund gradually - even $1,000 
      provides meaningful protection. Replenish after use before resuming other savings goals.

      High-interest credit card debt (typically 15-25% APR) should be prioritized for payoff. The avalanche method 
      (highest interest first) minimizes total interest paid, while the snowball method (smallest balance first) 
      provides psychological wins. Balance transfers to 0% APR cards can save thousands if paid off during the 
      promotional period. Student loan strategies depend on loan type and income - federal loans offer income-driven 
      repayment plans and potential forgiveness. Private loans may benefit from refinancing at lower rates if credit 
      has improved. Avoid new debt while paying down existing balances. Credit counseling is available for those 
      overwhelmed by debt.

      Real estate can provide diversification and potential income through rental properties or REITs (Real Estate 
      Investment Trusts). Direct property ownership requires significant capital for down payment (typically 20-25% 
      for investment properties), plus ongoing costs for maintenance, property taxes, insurance, and vacancy periods. 
      Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. REITs offer real estate exposure with liquidity and lower capital 
      requirements, trading like stocks. Tax benefits include mortgage interest deductions and depreciation. Location, 
      property condition, rental market demand, and interest rates significantly impact returns. Not suitable as 
      sole investment due to concentration risk and illiquidity.

    title: "What is Finance - Core Concepts and Principles"
    content: |
      Finance is the study and system of money management, including the creation, movement, and use of capital and funds. 
      It encompasses three main areas: (1) Personal Finance - managing individual money including budgeting, saving, investing, 
      insurance, mortgages, banking, and retirement planning; (2) Corporate Finance - how businesses manage capital structure, 
      funding sources, investment decisions, and shareholder returns through dividends and stock buybacks; (3) Public Finance - 
      government revenue collection through taxation, spending allocation, budget management, and economic policy. Key principles 
      include time value of money (money today is worth more than future money due to earning potential), risk-return tradeoff 
      (higher expected returns require accepting greater risk), diversification (spreading investments reduces risk), and 
      opportunity cost (choosing one option means forgoing alternatives). Finance also includes financial markets where 
      securities trade, financial institutions like banks that facilitate capital flow, and regulatory frameworks ensuring 
      market integrity.

      Effective risk management balances potential returns with acceptable loss levels. Standard deviation measures 
      portfolio volatility - higher values indicate greater price swings. Beta measures correlation with market movements 
      (beta >1 means more volatile than market). Sharpe ratio evaluates risk-adjusted returns (higher is better). 
      Diversification across asset classes, sectors, and geographies reduces unsystematic risk. Hedging strategies 
      include options, inverse ETFs, and bonds as ballast. Risk tolerance depends on time horizon, financial goals, 
      and emotional capacity for volatility. Regular rebalancing maintains target allocation and controls risk creep.

      Tax-advantaged accounts offer significant benefits through tax deferral or exemption. Traditional 401(k)/IRA 
      contributions are tax-deductible but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Roth 401(k)/IRA contributions 
      use after-tax dollars but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) offer triple tax 
      benefits - deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free medical withdrawals. 529 plans provide 
      tax-free growth for education expenses. Taxable brokerage accounts offer flexibility without restrictions but 
      lack tax advantages. Capital gains rates (0%, 15%, 20%) typically lower than ordinary income rates. Tax-loss 
      harvesting can offset gains. Asset location strategy places tax-inefficient investments in tax-advantaged accounts.

    content: |
      Credit scores (FICO, VantageScore) range from 300-850 and significantly impact borrowing costs. Scores above 
      740 typically qualify for best rates. Five factors affect scores: payment history (35%), credit utilization (30%), 
      credit history length (15%), credit mix (10%), and new credit inquiries (10%). Maintaining utilization under 30% 
      and paying bills on time are most impactful. Hard inquiries temporarily lower scores 5-10 points. Authorized 
      user status and credit builder loans can help build credit. Annual credit reports are free at AnnualCreditReport.com. 
      Dispute errors promptly. Credit freezes prevent identity theft. Good credit saves thousands in interest over a lifetime.

    title: "Dollar Cost Averaging vs Lump Sum Investing"
    content: |
      Dollar cost averaging (DCA) involves investing fixed amounts periodically, buying more shares when prices are 
      low and fewer when high. This reduces timing risk and emotional decision-making. Research shows lump sum 
      investing typically outperforms DCA about 66% of the time over long periods, as markets trend upward. However, 
      DCA provides psychological comfort and suits investors receiving regular income. For large windfalls (inheritance, 
      bonus), a hybrid approach investing 50% immediately and averaging the rest over 6-12 months balances performance 
      and risk management. Time in market generally beats timing the market for long-term investors.

    title: "ESG Investing - Environmental, Social, Governance Factors"
    content: |
      ESG investing integrates environmental (climate impact, resource use), social (labor practices, diversity, 
      community relations), and governance (board composition, executive compensation, shareholder rights) factors 
      into investment decisions. ESG funds screen companies based on sustainability criteria, with some excluding 
      controversial sectors (tobacco, weapons, fossil fuels). Research on ESG performance versus traditional investing 
      is mixed - some studies show comparable or better returns, others show underperformance. ESG appeals to values-based 
      investors and younger demographics. Greenwashing concerns require scrutiny of fund methodology. Higher expense 
      ratios common in ESG funds. Impact investing targets measurable social/environmental outcomes alongside returns.

    content: |
      Insurance protects against catastrophic financial risks. Term life insurance is most cost-effective for income 
      replacement, providing death benefit for specific period (10, 20, 30 years). Whole life/universal life combine 
      insurance with cash value but have higher premiums. Health insurance is essential to avoid medical bankruptcy - 
      understand deductibles, co-pays, out-of-pocket maximums, and network coverage. Disability insurance replaces 
      income if unable to work due to illness or injury - group policies through employers are most affordable. 
      Homeowners/renters insurance protects property and provides liability coverage. Auto insurance is legally required 
      in most states. Umbrella policies provide additional liability protection beyond standard policy limits.

    title: "Understanding Compound Interest and Growth"
    content: |
      Compound interest is interest earned on both principal and previously accumulated interest, creating exponential 
      growth over time. The Rule of 72 provides quick estimate: divide 72 by annual return rate to find years needed 
      to double money (e.g., 8% return = 9 years to double). $10,000 invested at 7% annual return grows to $20,000 
      in 10 years, $40,000 in 20 years, $80,000 in 30 years, demonstrating power of compounding. Starting early has 
      dramatic impact - investing $5,000 annually from age 25-35 (total $50K) typically outperforms investing same 
      annual amount from 35-65 (total $150K) due to additional growth time. Inflation erodes purchasing power - real 
      returns (nominal return minus inflation) matter for wealth building.

    title: "Financial Independence and FIRE Movement"
    content: |
      Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) movement emphasizes aggressive saving (typically 50-70% of income) 
      to achieve financial independence decades before traditional retirement age. The 4% rule suggests withdrawing 
      4% of portfolio annually in retirement, adjusting for inflation. To retire on $40K annual spending requires 
      $1M portfolio ($40K / 0.04). Variations include Lean FIRE (minimal spending), Fat FIRE (higher lifestyle), 
      Coast FIRE (savings sufficient for traditional retirement age), and Barista FIRE (part-time work covers expenses). 
      Success requires high income, frugal lifestyle, or both. Geographic arbitrage (lower cost areas), tax optimization, 
      and side income support sustainability. Not suitable for everyone - requires significant life trade-offs.

    content: |
      Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio compares stock price to earnings per share, with S&P 500 historical average around 
      15-16. Higher P/E suggests growth expectations or overvaluation; lower suggests value opportunity or concerns. 
      Price-to-Book (P/B) compares market value to book value (assets minus liabilities). Price-to-Sales (P/S) useful 
      for companies without positive earnings. PEG ratio (P/E divided by growth rate) accounts for growth expectations. 
      Dividend yield provides income component (dividends / price). Forward P/E uses projected future earnings. Valuation 
      alone insufficient for investment decisions - consider growth prospects, competitive position, management quality, 
      and sector dynamics. Compare valuations to historical norms and peers.

      education expenses (tuition, fees, books, room and board). Contributions may be state tax-deductible depending 
      on state. Investment options typically include age-based portfolios that automatically shift from stocks to 
      bonds as beneficiary approaches college age. Annual contribution limit $18,000 per beneficiary ($36,000 married 
      filing jointly) without gift tax. Superfunding allows $90,000 lump sum ($180,000 married) treating as 5 years 
      of gifts. Can change beneficiaries to family members. Non-qualified withdrawals incur 10% penalty plus taxes 
      on earnings. Recently expanded to cover K-12 tuition ($10K annually) and apprenticeship programs.

    title: "Understanding Inflation and Purchasing Power"
    content: |
      Inflation erodes purchasing power over time - $100 today buys less than $100 in future years. Federal Reserve 
      targets 2% annual inflation. Historical average inflation (1926-2023) approximately 3%. At 3% inflation, prices 
      double every 24 years (Rule of 72: 72/3 = 24). This means $1M today equals approximately $500K purchasing power 
      in 24 years. Investment returns must exceed inflation to build real wealth - 5% nominal return with 3% inflation 
      equals 2% real return. TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) adjust principal based on CPI. High inflation 
      periods favor real assets (real estate, commodities) over bonds. Cash and fixed-rate bonds most vulnerable to 
      inflation risk. Wages often lag inflation, reducing real income during high-inflation periods.

    title: "Behavioral Finance - Common Investor Biases"
    content: |
      Behavioral finance studies psychological factors affecting investment decisions. Loss aversion causes investors 
      to feel losses more intensely than equivalent gains, leading to holding losers too long. Recency bias overweights 
      recent events (buying high after rallies, selling low after declines). Confirmation bias seeks information 
      supporting existing beliefs. Herding follows crowd behavior (buying hot stocks, avoiding unloved sectors). 
      Overconfidence leads to excessive trading and concentration. Mental accounting treats money differently based 
      on source or account. Anchoring fixates on irrelevant reference points (past highs for stocks). Successful 
      investors recognize these biases and use systematic approaches (dollar-cost averaging, automatic rebalancing, 
      diversification) to counteract emotional decision-making.

      type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, improved mental health, better sleep, and weight management. Moderate intensity 
      includes brisk walking, water aerobics, cycling on level ground; vigorous includes jogging, swimming laps, cycling 
      uphill. Muscle-strengthening includes weights, resistance bands, bodyweight exercises, yoga. Start slowly and 
      gradually increase for deconditioned individuals. Any activity better than none - even 10-minute intervals provide

      (same bedtime/wake time daily including weekends); create dark, quiet, cool bedroom environment (60-67°F optimal); 
      avoid screens 1-2 hours before bed (blue light disrupts circadian rhythm); limit caffeine after 2pm and alcohol 
      before bed; exercise regularly but not close to bedtime; avoid large meals late in evening; reserve bedroom for 
      sleep and intimacy only. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is first-line treatment for chronic
