3. Classifies as: **Finance** | **Medical** | **Cross-Domain** | **General**
4. Confidence scoring for routing decisions (0.0-1.0)

**Classification Algorithm:**
```python
def classify_domain(self, query: str) -> Dict:
    # Financial keywords
    finance_keywords = ['investment', 'stock', 'portfolio', 'retirement', 'tax', 'loan']
    
    # Medical keywords  
    medical_keywords = ['symptom', 'treatment', 'diagnosis', 'medication', 'health']
    
    # Semantic similarity scoring
    finance_score = self._calculate_similarity(query, finance_keywords)
    medical_score = self._calculate_similarity(query, medical_keywords)
    
    return {
        'domain': 'finance' if finance_score > medical_score else 'medical',
        'confidence': max(finance_score, medical_score),
        'routing_decision': self._determine_agent_routing(finance_score, medical_score)
    }
```

**Performance Metrics:**

## 🎤 Potential Audience Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions

**Q1: "How do you ensure the quality and reliability of your 53 evidence sources?"**

**A:** We employ a rigorous multi-stage validation process:
- **Academic Verification:** All sources from peer-reviewed journals or government agencies
- **Reliability Scoring:** Each source scored 0.0-1.0 based on credibility metrics
- **Expert Validation:** Medical and financial professionals reviewed source selections  
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regular updates and quality checks
- **Diversity:** Mix of authoritative institutions (Mayo Clinic, SEC, Federal Reserve) and academic datasets

**Average reliability score: 0.847/1.0 with 40% high-reliability sources (0.9+)**

---

**Q2: "What happens when your local LLM (llama3.2) encounters queries it cannot handle adequately?"**

**A:** We have multiple fallback mechanisms:
- **Confidence Thresholding:** Responses below 0.6 confidence trigger additional evidence retrieval
- **Cross-Domain Routing:** Complex queries engage multiple agents
- **Internet RAG Backup:** Real-time information retrieval for current events
- **Graceful Degradation:** Clear uncertainty communication when confidence is low
- **Human Handoff Protocol:** For critical domains, system recommends professional consultation

**Example:** "I cannot provide definitive medical diagnosis. Please consult healthcare professionals. Based on symptoms mentioned, here's general information: [evidence-based response with sources]"

---

**Q3: "How does your FAIR scoring compare to existing AI evaluation metrics like BLEU or ROUGE?"**

**A:** FAIR metrics are fundamentally different from traditional NLP metrics:

**Traditional Metrics (BLEU/ROUGE):**
