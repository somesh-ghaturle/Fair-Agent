# PROJECT OVERVIEW STATEMENT

| **PROJECT OVERVIEW STATEMENT** | **Project Name:** | FAIR-Agent: Faithful, Adaptive, Interpretable, and Risk-Aware Agentic LLMs for Finance and Medicine | **Student Name:** | Somesh Ghaturle |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|

## Project Details

| **Problem/Opportunity:** |
|---------------------------|
| Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming finance and healthcare automation but lack adequate faithfulness, risk-awareness, and robust interpretability. This creates a risk of errors with serious financial and medical consequences. Existing systems focus primarily on accuracy, neglecting important aspects needed for trustable real-world deployment. Current multi-agent systems lack domain-specific adaptability and fail to provide sufficient transparency for high-stakes decision making in finance and medicine. |

| **Goal:** |
|-----------|
| Design, implement, and evaluate FAIR-Agent, a modular multi-agent LLM framework for finance and medicine domains that is faithful, adaptive, interpretable, and risk-aware. Utilize open-source LLMs and public datasets (FinQA, TAT-QA, MIMIC-IV, PubMedQA) to benchmark and improve safety and reliability. Create a production-ready system with Docker containerization and comprehensive evaluation framework. |

## SMART Objectives

| **Criteria** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Specific:** | Build and benchmark a modular multi-agent LLM system focused on trust and adaptability for finance and medical domains |
| **Measurable:** | Achieve ≥20% improvement in faithfulness, calibration, and robustness metrics over baselines |
| **Assignable:** | To be completed by Somesh Ghaturle under academic supervision |
| **Realistic:** | Use publicly accessible datasets and open-source LLMs on available compute resources |
| **Time-Related:** | Complete the work in 4–6 months with final submission as per academic schedule |
